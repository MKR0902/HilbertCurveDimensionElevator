# HilbertCurveDimensionElevator
Uses an algorithim to turn (x, y) coordinates (2D) into its corresponding value on the Hilbert Curve. It can also go from a singular value back to (x, y) as long as you know what grid it would be on. If you do not know what the grid size is, then it automatically finds the smallest grid size containing the value inputed. Grid sizes should typically be some length 2^n but the program will find the smallest n for 2^n that contains the size given.
